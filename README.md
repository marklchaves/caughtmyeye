## work in progress

I'm migrating my portfolios from marklchaves.com over to this site.

marklchaves.com was a WordPress site running on SiteGround. I hope to have that shut down by the end of 2019. **Update**: shutdown mid-March 2020.

**Edit**: This is all done. The site is live and it also works as a PWA.

caughtmyeye.dev's first gallery showcases my photos of **surabaya**&mdash;Indonesia's second-largest city. For this collection, I added some custom code to support _art direction_ responsive web design. This means now I can supply a mobile-friendly (portrait) hero that will display by default (mobile-first), then it's overridden by the _landscape_ version on screens `768px` and larger. Get on the [live demo on my surabaya gallery](https://www.caughtmyeye.dev/photography/surabaya/). Switch from desktop to mobile. Notice how the _becak_ driver stays (partially) in the frame on small devices. Without this code, he would be completely "hacked" out of the screen.

[See the gist if you are interested.](https://gist.github.com/marklchaves/589cf392b5076d46b5fc0037bff7e74e)

> I'll try to do a complete write-up. Maybe even try my first pull request.

**Edit**: I did a pull request.

### pull request to minimal mistakes 25 November 2019

I submitted a pull request (PR) for my _art direction_ hero code. There's no movement yet. Judging from what kinds of things get into the theme (and what gets rejected), I'm not holding my breath. But I did a nice write-up. Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/2331). Give it a _thumbs up_ if you like it.

**Edit**: My PR was rejected.

## about the homepage

### threads

The homepage is kinda sorta like a _family album_. It's mainly by me for me. Writing for oneself is actually more liberating than I thought. I probably knew that at one point. But, after years of writing for other people, I guess one forgets. 

Anyway, since I'm writing for me, readers will get a more genuine sense of who I am. I decided to post because all my little quirks, limitations, and faves live in the images. I include the backstories for the photos. I seldom share the back story behind my photos. Because I always think that people really don't care these days&mdash;i.e., swipe, swipe, swipe.

### masonry grid

One weekend back in late June 2019, I stumbled upon an article called [Building a Responsive Portfolio using Jekyll and Masonry](https://kfrankc.com/posts/2019/03/07/jekyll-masonry#result). I decided to code up this site (caughtmyeye.dev originally called c r e a t i n g) that weekend by following kfrankc's instructions. It was fun. There were definitely some hurdles, e.g., my first Jekyll site, usual environment setup pains, gaps in the instructions, and an interesting bug on window resize (see my fix below).

[Gist of modified portfolio-masonry.js to fix window resize issues.](https://gist.github.com/marklchaves/bbd7f88032c67582774fe4f6343f6ff4)

I was pleased with the result. So much so, I decided to ditch my WordPress site of less than a year old. I was on format.com for many years before WordPress. I switched to Jekyll because I wanted to (re) start web development on my own projects instead of others all the time (I've been a freelance web dev since 2015 and originally a software engineer/manager). You can learn more in [my write-up comparing CloudCannon with WordPress](https://medium.com/@marklchaves/cloudcannon-versus-wordpress-e0ff63fdb4c0).

OK enough for now. More later.
