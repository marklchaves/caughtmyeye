## work in progress

I've migrating my portfolios from [marklchaves.com](https://marklchaves.com) over to this site.

marklchaves.com was a WordPress site running on SiteGround. I hope to have that shut down by the end of 2019. **Update**: shutdown mid-March 2020.

CaughtMyEye.dev's first gallery showcases my photos of **surabaya**--Indonesia's second largest city. For this collection, I added some custom code to support _art direction_ responsive web design. This means now I can supply a mobile friendly (portrait) hero that will display by default (mobile first), but will be overridden by it's _landscape_ version on screens `768px` and larger. Get on the [live demo on my surabaya gallery](https://caughtmyeye.dev/photography/surabaya/). Switch from desktop to mobile. Notice how the _becak_ driver stays (partially) in the frame on small devices. Without this code, he would be completely "hacked" out of the screen.

[see the gist, if you are interested.](https://gist.github.com/marklchaves/589cf392b5076d46b5fc0037bff7e74e)

> I'll try to do a more complete write-up. Maybe even try my first pull request.

**New update.**

### pull request to minimal mistakes 25 November 2019

I submitted a pull request for my _art direction_ hero code. No movement yet. Judging from what kinds of things get into the theme (and what gets rejected), I'm not holding my breath. But, I did a nice write-up. Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/2331). Give it a _thumbs up_ if you like it.

## about the homepage

### stories

The homepage is kinda sorta like a _family album_. It's mainly by me for me. writing for oneself is actually more liberating than I thought. I probably knew that at one point. But, after years of writing for other people, I guess one forgets. Anyway, since i'm writing for me, I think readers will get a more genuine sense of who I am. Because all my little quirks, limitations, and faves will be infused through the images I painfully decide to post. I include the back stories for the images. I seldom/rarely share the back story behind my photos. Because I always think that people really don't care these days--i.e. swipe, swipe, swipe.

### masonry grid

One weekend back in late June 2019, I stumbled upon an article called [Building a Responsive Portfolio using Jekyll and Masonry](https://kfrankc.com/posts/2019/03/07/jekyll-masonry#result). I decided to code up this site (CaughtMyEye.dev originally called c r e a t i n g) that weekend by following kfrankc's instructions. It was fun. There were definitely some hurdles e.g. my first jekyll site, usual environment set up pains, gaps in the instructions, and a interesting bug on window resize (see my fix below).

[Gist of modified portfolio-masonry.js to fix window resize issues.](https://gist.github.com/marklchaves/bbd7f88032c67582774fe4f6343f6ff4)

I was pleased with the result. So much so, I recently decided to ditch my wordpress site of less than a year old. I was on format.com for many years before wordpress. I switched to wordpress because I wanted to (re) start web development on my own projects instead of others all the time (i've been a freelance web dev since 2015 and originally a software engineer/manager). You can read more about my motivations to switch in [my write up comparing CloudCannon with WordPress](https://medium.com/@marklchaves/cloudcannon-versus-wordpress-e0ff63fdb4c0).

OK enough for now. More later.
