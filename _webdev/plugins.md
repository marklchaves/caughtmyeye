> bringing the power of the swiper js library to wordpress

this is a minimalist plugin for displaying responsive cards in a slide.

on a wide screen device, the slide will show a horizontal card (image on the left and text on the right). on a small device, the slide becomes a stacked card with the image on the top and text on the bottom.

stay tuned for a custom gutenberg block version that's in the works.

## gallery image captions (gic)

a wordpress filter for gallery captions. 

with gic, you can display the title, caption, and description image attributes. that's right! gic uses the image meta data from your media library for your captions. you can also change/filter the rendering html to whatever you want.

the gic plugin overrides the wordpress gallery shortcode function to create a hook. this hook allows you use and customise image meta data for your captions.

there's no more time wasted trying to figure out what happened to your captions in your page builder and then having to re-add captions you already have. yes, you can finally manage all your gallery image captions in 1 place and where they belong&mdash;in your media library.
