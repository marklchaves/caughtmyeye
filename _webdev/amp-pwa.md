## AMP and PWA

AMP stands for accelerated mobile page. An AMP Story is similar to a Snapchat/IG style story. 

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are known for advanced browser caching, being **installable**, and working _offline_.
Combining the two are a sweet match for showing off portfolios, products, and (yes) sharing your stories. These apps are fast. Google PageSpeed loves them. And, they can run **without** an internet connection once they're installed!

Now that's wicked cool.

The _ini bali_ and Hope apps are AMP Stories running as PWAs.
