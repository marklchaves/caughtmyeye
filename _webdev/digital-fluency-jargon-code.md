# Digital Fluency: Why You Should Embrace Technical Jargon and Writing Code!

There are 1.72 billion [websites in the world](https://www.statista.com/chart/19058/how-many-websites-are-there/). 3.5 billion of us [are online](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media). 3.8 billion people are [using email](https://www.statista.com/statistics/255080/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide/).

>Americans [fear technology](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/americans-are-more-afraid-of-robots-than-death/410929/) more than death!
