## thrashing in the middle of the pandemic

pasar ubud (traditional market) went through a major renovation a couple of years back. the pasar vendors had to set up their stalls on the main streets of ubud because of the project.

one morning i skated down jalan raya ubud (main street). i saw this lady wearing a thrasher hoodie. i made this portrait, and then i told her what _thrasher_ meant.
