## san francisco

the *first* time i went to san francisco was during a family trip to the philippines. i don't remember the exact year. but, i remember wearing polyester track jackets on top of polyester disco shirts with matching polyester bell bottoms. if i had to guess it was around my junior-high years 1977-79.

i find myself *tripping* back to san francisco since then. i did a gig with oracle corp on the peninsula for one whole summer. i stayed downtown and commuted to the redwood shores campus every morning--back to the nikko every night.

i eventually moved to southern california. the two main jobs i worked were based in san diego. but, i was required to travel to san francisco occasionally for business. i entertained (half hearted) an offer to **relocate** to sf from sd at one point. that required a semi-serious house hunting trip around the bay area.

then my daughter emily got accepted to the **san francisco art institute** (sfai). she went for a year or so. i helped move her up there. i went back again shortly after via another road trip. this time with our dog phoenix in emily's two-door bimmer that i bought for her to use when she was in high school. i sold the bimmer on the spot upon arrival (at the honda dealer on the corner of van ness and market). this was back in 2011. it was my *goodbye to the USA* trip before moving to bali.

i was in sf again in 2016 for emily's graduation from laney college in oakland. then again in 2017. it's late 2019 as i write this *journal entry*. i feel that i'm **overdue** for a visit.
