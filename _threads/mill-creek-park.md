## a special place

i'm drowning in deep nostalgia these days. more than usual. 

i often find myself wandering through [mill creek park](https://www.millcreekmetroparks.org/). i can feel the bark on her trees. i can taste her musty forest. in my mind, i can still lie down on her soft grassy lawns.

mill creek is where i learned how to ice skate. it's the place where i made my first "serious" photographs. it's where i had my first kiss.

i always had a strong affinity for this bridge. it felt so <em>out of place</em> with its surroundings.
