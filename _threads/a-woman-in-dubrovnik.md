## i thought i would have remembered

i thought i would've remembered every photo i've ever made. i don't recall making this one.

i was surprised i still had a copy of it. i've tossed out so many ancient prints&mdash;probably thousands. that's another thread for a another time.

i'm happy i found this _little gem_. something about the woman's expression that catches my eye. 

then, the lines of the steps and the children with the man sitting. waiting.
