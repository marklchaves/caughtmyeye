## first ocean

this year (2025), i went on a mission to surf as much as i could before the next rainy season here in bali. it's a long story, but last year's rainy season went well into July-August. that's about a 10-month long rainy season (uncanny).

after i got out of the ocean during my last session (before the rains began this past november), i saw someone on the beach wading in the shallows. they had a small inflatable raft. that's something you don't see everyday where i got to surf.

seeing that small toy raft in the ocean made me remember my first memory of the ocean. not sure exactly how old we (my and my brothers) were, but we on a family vacation to myrtle beach, south carolina. we were still in primary school for sure.

i remember smelling the salt in the air for the very first time while we were still in the car driving to our hotel. my dad said, "can you smell the ocean?"

on that trip, my dad bought 2 inflatable "toys" for us. one was an inner tube. the other, you guessed it, was a small raft.
