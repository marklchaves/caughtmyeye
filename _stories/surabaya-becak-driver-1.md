when i'm in surabaya (Indonesia's *second* city), i'm always drawn to photographing <abbr title="a three-wheeled pedicab where the passengers sit in the front.">becak</abbr> drivers. i'm sure i'm not the only street photographer to feel this way. 

it's easy to photograph a becak driver. in surabaya, they're as ubiquitous as nasi, mie, warungs, &amp; *kaki limas*. like their cousins, the [kaki limas](https://balistreetphotographer.com/2018/03/19/the-kaki-lima-one-of-ubuds-contradictions/), these becak driver's are the street. it's only natural for a street photographer to have an affinity with them.

this gentleman at the _ampel_ district, wanted to be photographed. yet he was shy. the woman behind him was *egging* him on to **smile**. i'm glad when people don't smile for the camera. i always prefer be just be themselves i.e., oblivious to the camera and the photographer.

he was fidgety at first. but, i took my time focusing and checking settings on my old analogue SLR. eventually, he became more relaxed and seemed to ignore me.
