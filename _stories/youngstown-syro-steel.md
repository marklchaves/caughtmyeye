## yo

what can i say. i still call *youngstown* "home". meaning, when people ask me where i'm from, i generally say *youngstown, ohio*.

when i was growing up there in the 70s-80s, "y-town is my town" was the city's tagline. now, people just call it **yo**.

pictured above is the old **syro steel** plant in girard, ohio. girard is just outside of y-town. my brother and i went to grade-school in girard. we used to pass up steel mills like this one every day on the way to school. they (steel mills) all began to die on [black monday](https://www.wkbn.com/news/40-years-later-effects-of-black-monday-still-apparent-in-youngstown/) september 19, 1977.

the **syro steel** photo was taken in 2016 on an old canon ft/ql using kodak portra 160. i don't like to talk about gear much. but, youngstown is where i learned photography. my dad taught me. he gave me a minolta srt101 (similar to the canon i have now) when i was 17. he told me to use ilford black and white [film](/photography/film). i did.
