ian in ibizia spain c. 1985/86. 

this was probably our first family vacation. i was stationed at RAF Lakenheath in the UK at the time. looking back, ibizia seems like such a random place to go. i guess it was where all the cool UK people liked to hang back then. maybe it still is.

ian was about 1-years old. the way his silhouette looked here _caught my eye_. against the mediterranean and the mountains in the background. as the sun was setting.

ian in akron ohio 2016. 

about thirty years later and 7,000 km away. also on film. i made this portrait for his graduation from akron law. you can tell he wasn't thrilled about being photographed. i guess it runs in the family.
