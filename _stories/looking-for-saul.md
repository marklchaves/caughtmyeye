## saul leiter

**saul leiter** was originally from pittsburgh pa. i grew up about an hour away from pittsburgh.

*seeing* saul's photography is one of my favourite addictions. his photos are art. his pictures are poetry. and, saul's art has been and still is counter to main stream photography. timeless and priceless.

saul passed in 2013. i keep *looking for saul* when i walk the streets of ubud.
